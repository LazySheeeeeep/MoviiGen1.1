In an animated sequence, the first shot shows a young Caucasian man with spiky blonde hair, wearing black sunglasses, an open blue jacket with white ruffled collar/cuffs revealing his chest, and white pants. Against a dark background, he spreads his arms, emitting several blue energy rings. This hard cuts to a second shot inside a dimly lit cave with reddish-brown walls and torches. Here, a young Caucasian woman with short black hair, dressed in a white and gold outfit with grey leggings and white boots, holds a glowing blue shield and tackles the man from the side, wrapping her arms around him.

The first shot is a static medium shot from an eye-level angle. The second shot is a static medium shot from a slightly low angle.

The first shot features a dark color palette dramatically highlighted by the bright blue energy effects, with lighting originating from these rings. The second shot has a warmer tone dominated by the reddish-brown cave walls and yellow highlights from the torchlight. The overall atmosphere is tense and action-packed, rendered in a colorful animation style featuring cel-shading, high contrast, stylized backgrounds, motion blur, flat shading, rim lighting, clean lines, and vibrant colors.
