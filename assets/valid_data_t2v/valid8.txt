Outdoors in a dimly lit grassy field, a young adult or adult Black female soldier kneels on the ground. She is outfitted in a grey digital camouflage uniform, a tactical vest, fingerless gloves, and a dark grey military helmet marked "U-76H". The camera initially captures a low-angle close-up of her gloved hands pulling a clump of grass from the earth. It then executes a tilt upwards, settling into a medium close-up to close-up shot (eye-level or slightly low relative to her face) as she brings the uprooted grass close, examining it intently with a serious and focused expression.

The camera movement consists of a tilt shot, transitioning from a close-up on the hands to a medium close-up/close-up on the soldier's face and the grass she holds. The focus remains sharp on the soldier and the object of her attention.

The scene is characterized by dim, diffuse, soft lighting, suggesting overcast conditions. The overall color palette is cool, desaturated, and subdued, dominated by greyish-blue tones with a slightly blue tint and muted greens, leaning towards a grayscale appearance due to the low saturation. Film grain is present. The atmosphere is serious, focused, and somewhat somber.
