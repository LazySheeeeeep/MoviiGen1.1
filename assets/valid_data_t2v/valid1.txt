Outdoors during the daytime in front of the brick Kirkmouth Police Station building, a young Caucasian woman with reddish-brown, shoulder-length hair, wearing a dark green long coat over a lighter top and a watch, stops walking. She uses her black smartphone with a serious expression, briefly raising it as if to take a photo. In the background, a police officer in a yellow high-visibility jacket walks along a ramp, while another officer in a dark uniform stands near the entrance.

The camera initially follows the woman with a slight pan and truck left in a medium shot, then settles into a static medium close-up, maintaining focus on her at an eye-level angle.

The scene is lit by flat, diffused daylight under an overcast sky, creating a naturalistic, slightly desaturated, and cool-toned color palette influenced by the weather and scene elements. The atmosphere is neutral and slightly serious. It features slight grain, natural lighting, realism, a modern digital feel, low saturation, and sharp details.
