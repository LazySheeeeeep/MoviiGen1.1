## üõ†Ô∏è Training

### Training Framework

Our training framework is built on [FastVideo](https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/FastVideo), with custom implementation of sequence parallel to optimize memory usage and training efficiency. The sequence parallel approach allows us to distribute the computational load across multiple GPUs, enabling efficient training of large-scale video generation models.

#### Key Features:

- **Sequence Parallel & Ring Attention**: Our custom implementation divides the temporal dimension across multiple GPUs, reducing per-device memory requirements while maintaining model quality.
- **Efficient Data Loading**: Optimized data pipeline for handling high-resolution video frames (Latent Cache and Text Embedding Cache). 
- **Multi Resolution Training Bucket**: Support for training at multiple resolutions.
- **Mixed Precision Training**: Support for BF16/FP16 training to accelerate computation.
- **Distributed Training**: Seamless multi-node, multi-GPU training support.

### Data Preprocessing

We cache the videos and corresponding text prompts as latents and text embeddings to optimize the training process. This preprocessing step significantly improves training efficiency by reducing computational overhead during the training phase.

```bash
cd scripts/data_preprocess
bash scripts/data_preprocess/preprocess.sh
```
Example Data Format:

training_data.json
```json
[
    {
        "cap": "your prompt",
        "path": "path/to/your/video.mp4",
        "resolution": {
            "width": 3840,
            "height": 2160
        },
        "fps": 23.976023976023978,
        "duration": 1.4180833333333331
    },
    ...
]
```
merge.txt:
```txt
relative_path_to_json_dir, training_data.json
```

Output Json:

video_caption.json
```json
[
    {
        "latent_path": "path/to/your/latent.pt",
        "prompt_embed_path": "path/to/your/prompt_embed.pt",
        "length": 12
    },
    ...
]
```

### Train
```bash
bash scripts/train/finetune.sh
```

**When multi-node training, you need to set the number of nodes and the number of processes per node manually.** We provide a sample script for multi-node training.

```bash
bash scripts/bash/finetune_multi_node.sh
```
